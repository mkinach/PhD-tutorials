# RNPL

The code in this directory illustrates basic functionality of RNPL (Rapid Numerical Prototyping Language). This directory contains several examples:
1. `klein-gordon` -- solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in 1D
2. `ode-relax` -- solution of coupled systems of ODEs using RNPL's built-in Newton-Gauss-Seidel relaxation

In `rnpletal-installguide.md` I provide instructions on how to install the RNPL compiler and necessary libraries, along with visualization software XVS and DV.
