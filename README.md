PhD Tutorials for UBC Numerical Relativity
==========================================

This repository contains my tutorials for new students in the [UBC
Numerical Relativity Group](http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca).  Most of the
necessary software can be downloaded from the group's [software
page](http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/Group/Software.html).

* **DVR** -- the remote version of DV, a data visualization utility for 1D, 2D and 3D data
* **GRtensor** -- a tensor calculus package for the computer algebra system *Maple*
* **HPC** -- various tutorials for using the UBC ARC and DRAC/Compute Canada HPC platforms
* **MPI** -- a communication protocol for parallel programming in various languages
* **PAMR** -- a set of libraries for solving PDEs using parallel adaptive mesh refinement
* **pFUnit** -- a unit testing framework for Fortran
* **RNPL** -- a specialized language and compiler for solving PDEs with finite-differences
* **elliptic** -- a basic implementation of several algorithms for solving elliptic PDEs  
* **interpolation** -- a basic implementation of several interpolating algorithms for 1D and 2D data
* **shell-scripts** -- several utility scripts for various research tasks
